# REST-API-for-discussion-forum

REST API using Express and Mongoose, for a discussion forum similar to Reddit. A user can:

1. Create posts
2. List and sort posts by date of creation.
3. Edit/Update posts
4. Delete posts

Only an authenticated user is allowed to interact with the API. Used Google Oauth in Passport js to authenticate the users.
